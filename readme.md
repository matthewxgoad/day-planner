## Description

This application allows the user to input a description for each hour of a typical 8-5 workday. They can store those descriptions locally in their browsers so that they repopulate on a page reload. The background color of each hour updates to reflect current, past, and future times. 

## Credits

This project was completed with the help of friends, classmates, and instructors. 

Special shout outs to Kurt, Chris, and Mark. LLAP
